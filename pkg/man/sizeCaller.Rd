sizeCaller
}
\description{
The function extracts positions of standard peaks from an ABIF file and calculates the sizes of products in specified channels.
}
\usage{
sizeCaller(x_abifile, rsizes = c(50, 75, 100, 139, 150, 160, 200, NA, 300, NA, 350, 400, 450, 490, 500), ranges = matrix(rep(c(2.3, 8), sum(npeaks.per.channel)), nrow = sum(npeaks.per.channel), byrow = TRUE), ranges.bp, thres_start = 2, channels = 1:4, npeaks.per.channel = rep(1, length(channels)), locus.names = paste(rep("V", length(channels)), 1:sum(npeaks.per.channel), sep = ""), strain.name = deparse(substitute(x_abifile)), ...)

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x_abifile}{
list generated by \code{seqinr::read.abif} representing the ABIF file
}
  \item{rsizes}{
sizes of reference peaks in basepairs. peaks not to be counted are given as NA.
}
  \item{ranges}{
matrix of time ranges across which peaks are looked for in channels specified in \code{channels}
}
  \item{ranges.bp}{
matrix of basepair ranges across which peaks are looked for in channels specified in \code{channels}. If given, this matrix overrides matrix \code{ranges}.
}
  \item{thres_start}{
threshhold, below which peaks are looked for (see function \code{seqinr::peakabif})
}
  \item{channels}{
channel numbers containing products of unknown sizes
}
  \item{npeaks.per.channel}{
array containing number of peaks per channel (defaults to one peak per channel)
}
  \item{locus.names}{
array of locus names
}
  \item{strain.name}{
name of strain to be analyzed
}
  \item{\dots}{
arguments passed on to \code{searchStandardPeaks(...)}
}
