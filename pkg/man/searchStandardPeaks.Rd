searchStandardPeaks
}
\description{
The function looks for the standard size ladder in an electropherogram (ABIF) file. ABIF files have to be imported using \code{seqinr::read.abif()}. 
If successful, the function returns the peak positions the size standard.
}
\usage{
searchStandardPeaks(x_abifile, refchannel = 5, reference = r_npk, npks = 15, x_tmin = 2, x_tmax = 3, x_thres = 0.5, x_step = 0.1, dist_thres = 0.01)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x_abifile}{
list generated by \code{seqinr::read.abif} representing the ABIF file
}
  \item{refchannel}{
channel number of the size ladder. See \code{seqinr::peakabif}.
}
  \item{reference}{
contains normalized peak positions. Peak positions can be extracted from an ABIF file with \code{seqinr::peakabif}. Normalization is achieved with \code{normPeaks}.  
}
  \item{npks}{
number of expected peaks
}
  \item{x_tmin}{
starting time for the time axis for x_abifile (see function \code{seqinr::peakabif})
}
  \item{x_tmax}{
ending time for the time axis for x_abifile (see function \code{seqinr::peakabif})
}
  \item{x_thres}{
threshold, above which peaks are looked for in x_abifile (see function \code{seqinr::peakabif})
}
  \item{x_step}{
step, by which x_thres is decreased and x_tmin increased until standard peaks are retrieved
}
  \item{dist_thres}{
euclidian distance of peak vectors, below which identity of references in x_abifile and reference is assumed
}
